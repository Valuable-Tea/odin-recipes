    <h3>Meatball Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground meat:</strong> This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Italian bread:</strong> Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Fry the meatballs in olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
